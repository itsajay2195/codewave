## üöÄ How to use

- Install packages with `yarn` or `npm install`.
  - If you have native iOS code run `npx pod-install`
- Run `yarn start` to start the bundler.
- Open the project in a React runtime to try it:
  - iOS: [Client iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779)
  - Android: [Client Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=blankexample)

## üöÄ How to run on emulator (iOS and Android)

1. iOS(macOS):
  - Go to your project directory.
  - Run `yarn iOS` will start the expo developer tools on a port from the browser window.
  - In Split seconds you will see expo automatically open the app in the simulator.
  - On the first instance expo will be installing the "Expo Go" app on the simulator.
  - After the successful installation of "Expo Go" you will see the app(project) in the simulator.
  - If expo fails to open/ recognize the iOS simaltor on your mac, you can go to the browser window on which expo bundler is present and manually run the app on the simulator by clicking "run on iOS simulator".

2. Android:
  - Go to your project directory.
  - Run `yarn android` will start the the expo developer tools on a port from the browser window.
  - You will have to keep the andorid emulator open and running.
  - Once the emulator is ready, you can go to the browser window on which expo bundler is present and manually run the app on the emulator by clicking "run on Android emulator".
  - On the first instance expo will be installing the "Expo Go" app on the emulator.
  - After the successful installation of "Expo Go" you will see the app(project) in the emulator.

## Running the app on real device

## Adding Native Code

This project can be run from a web browser or the Expo client app. You may find that you want to add more native code later on. You can do this by ejecting the project and rebuilding it yourself.

- Run `yarn eject` to create the native projects.
- You can still run your project in the web browser or Expo client, you just won't be able to access any new native modules you add.

## Publishing

- Deploy the native app to the App store and Play store using this guide: [Deployment](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/app-stores/).
- Deploy the website using this guide: [Web deployment](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/publishing-websites/).
